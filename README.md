TDD Katas
=====

If you recall from our discussions on TDD, "A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition.
In 1999, the term was used by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)">[1]</a>.  If you want to read up more on the code kata, check it out <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/">here</a>.   

The point of a kata is to practice doing the SAME exercise mulutiple times until it becomes ingrained in your brain.  In other words, "Practice makes Perfect."  

You will find in this repository a set of TDD katas.  They are simple coding challenges that should be solved using Test Driven Development.  Make sure you follow the TDD cycle.  It's very easy to miss the point of TDD, so review this 3 minute video by Uncle Bob on TDD :

Below is a synopsis of the TDD katas found in this exercise Note that the the code is done on the below website is in C#:
