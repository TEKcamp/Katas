TDD Katas
=====

If you recall from our discussions on TDD, "AÂ code kataÂ is an exercise inÂ programmingÂ which helpsÂ programmersÂ hone their skills through practice and repetition.
In 1999, the term was used byÂ Dave Thomas, co-author of the bookÂ The Pragmatic Programmer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)">[1]</a>.  If you want to read up more on the code kata, check it out <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/">here</a>.   

The point of a kata is to practice doing the SAME exercise mulutiple times until it becomes ingrained in your brain.  In other words, "Practice makes Perfect."  

You will find in this repository a set of TDD katas.  They are simple coding challenges that should be solved using Test Driven Development.  Make sure you follow the TDD cycle. You will start with the class files in the kata-tests folder.  Then you will step by step start writing your actual code in the katas directory.  Write only enough code to get the test to pass, and then oscillate back to the tests and add more test cases until you've arrived at good working solution, backed by test code.

It's very easy to miss the point of TDD, so review this 3 minute video by Uncle Bob on TDD :

After this, watch the longer 60 minute video on TDD by our Uncle Bob here :

Below is a synopsis of the TDD katas found in this exercise Note that the the code is done on the below website is in C#:

If you have practiced all of these katas for a couple of weeks, you may want to grab a copy of TDD, by Kent Beck.

This is the goto reference source that set the stage for TDD.  

May the tests be with you, my young apprentices ðŸ˜Ž
